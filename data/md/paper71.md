_**Abstract**_ **—The continuous expanded scale of the industrial**
**Internet of Things (IIoT) leads to IIoT equipments generating**
**massive amounts of user data every moment. According to the**
**different requirement of end users, these data usually have high**
**heterogeneity and privacy, while most of users are reluctant**
**to expose them to the public view. How to manage these**
**time series data in an efficient and safe way in the field of**
**IIoT is still an open issue, such that it has attracted extensive**

I. I NTRODUCTION


Human society is rapidly moving towards the era of industry
4.0 [1]. The global distribution of user equipments (UEs) is
widespread and decentralized due to the influence of geographic location. Limited by the costs of transmission media
(cables, optical fibers) and communication delays, traditional
network infrastructures are not suitable for the development
of Industry 4.0 [2]. On the other hand, wireless networks
are widely used in Industry 4.0 because of its flexibility and
portability. The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one key
technology to realize Industry 4.0. Many applications of IIoT
are based on wireless networks, such as intelligent robots,

driverless cars, smart grid and smart medical [3]. Fig. 1 shows
the IIoT scenario under the background of rapid development
of social science and technology. A large number of IIoT
equipments access to IIoT frequently, which can produce
a huge amount of data in a short period of time [4], [5].
Radio network resource management faces severe challenges,
including storage, spectrum, computing resource allocation,
and joint allocation of multiple resources [6], [7]. With the
rapid development of communication networks, the integrated
space-ground network has also become a key research object

[8]. How to efficiently manage, store and use these time series
data has become an important research topic.
The data generated by IIoT equipments often involves users’
private information [9], [10]. Service providers and users do
not want this information to be exposed to the third party, but
this kind of data is usually vulnerable to attacks from heterogeneous networks, heterogeneous equipments or malware

[11]. Therefore, there needs an approach to support IIoT, that
cannot only maintain the heterogeneity and privacy of data,
but also reduce the communication cost and model training
deviation [12], [13]. As a new type of machine learning (ML)
paradigm, federated learning (FL) has attracted great attention
in the industry [14]. FL prevents the leakage of users’ personal
private information to a certain extent by separating the central
server’s direct access to the original data from the model
training [15], [16]. In addition, FL can effectively maintain
the heterogeneity of data and reduce the deviation of model
training. Reference [17] has proved that FL can be effectively
applied to multiple learning tasks. Considering the privacy,
heterogeneity and wide distribution of the device data in IIoT,
FL in IIoT may have a positive effect.
With the rapid popularization of IIoT technology, the geographical distribution of IIoT equipments is becoming more
and more extensive and the equipment forms are quite different
from each other [18]. This leads to a series of problems such
as uneven data quality of equipment and high communication
cost. In order to increase the model training rate of IIoT
equipments and reduce the communication cost of model
aggregation, driven by the current artificial intelligence (AI)
technologies, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
assisted FL framework [19], [20]. DRL algorithm is suitable
for solving decision-making problems in high dimensions [21],

[22], so it can use the decision-making effect of DRL to
select some high-quality local IIoT equipment models for
aggregation. Considering that a large amount of data generated
by IIoT equipments will lead to excessive training data,
increase the burden on wireless network channels and may
cause privacy leaks, we employ a distributed method to train

DRL agents, i.e., apply the DRL assisted FL method on each
IIoT equipment to realize the effective application of FL in
IIoT. The main work of this paper is as follows:

devices due to the generation of large amounts of
heterogeneous and private data, this paper adopts a FL

gradient (DDPG) is mainly used to select IIoT device
nodes with high data quality, so as to increase the model
aggregation rate and reduce communication costs.

and then use MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10
(IID and non-IID) data sets for experimental evaluation.

_Deep Reinforcement Learning_


IIoT has been widely concerned by the industry. Especially
in the field of IIoT, there have been many solutions to solve
the practical problems of IIoT by using AI technology. Due
to the explosive growth of user equipments and data streams,
IIoT has seen a shortage of spectrum resources. Shi et al. [23]
proposed a spectrum resource management scheme for IIoT
networks. Specifically, in order to consider the differentiated
communication needs of different users, the authors proposed
a modified deep Q-learning network (MDQN) and designed a
new reward function to drive the learning process. Afterwards,
the authors established a simple medium access control model,
which used the base station as the sole agent to manage
spectrum resources. In the end, the solution promoted the
sharing of spectrum between different types of users. Chen et
al. [24] studied the joint power control and dynamic resource
management of multi-access edge computing (MEC) in IIoT.
The authors transformed this problem into Markov decision
process (MDP) and used the dynamic resource management
algorithm based on DRL to solve this process. The algorithm
fully considered the dynamic and continuity of task generation,
and finally used the DDPG to optimize the long-term average
delay of dynamic resource management. The experimental
results showed that the method was effective. Based on

blockchain technology, Liu et al. [25] proposed an emerging
data collection and sharing scheme to deal with the two main
problems faced by IIoT. The first was to achieve efficient


IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2020 3



data collection within the limited energy and sensing range
of mobile terminals. The second was to ensure the security of
data sharing between mobile terminals. The authors combined
blockchain and DRL algorithms, used DRL to maximize data
collection, and then used blockchain technology to ensure data
security. This scheme embodied the superior performance of
the two technologies.


_B. Related Work of Industrial Internet of Things Based on_
_Federal Learning_

The latest development of FL in IIoT was an efficient
deep anomaly detection framework based on equipment joint
learning proposed by Liu et al. [26], which was used to
detect time series data in IIoT. The authors first used a FL
framework to enable edge equipments to co-train an anomaly
model. After that, they used the attention mechanism-based
convolutional neural network (CNN) long short-term memory
(LSTM) model to capture important fine-grained features. In
the end, the authors used a gradient compression mechanism
based on Top-k selection to improve communication efficiency.
A large number of experiments on real data sets showed that
the algorithm can effectively reduce communication overhead.
FL was originally proposed by Brendan et al. [27]. They first
proposed a decentralized method for private data training–FL,
and then conducted extensive experimental evaluations using
five different model structures and four data sets to verify the
robustness of the FL method. This research opened a precedent
for the exploration of FL technology. In addition, there were
some typical representatives who applied FL to solve different
actual network problems [28]–[32], which had shown good
results in solving the computing, caching and communication,
and IIoT problems of the intelligent mobile edge.
We summarize the application classification of FL and
DRL in TABLE I. Similar to the above works, we have
jointly paid attention to the data privacy issues in the IIoT
scene, and proposed feasible solutions from the perspective
of design framework and algorithm implementation. However,
the biggest difference between our work and the above works
is that we use DRL algorithm to select high-quality IIoT
equipment nodes for FL, so as to improve the rate of model
aggregation and reduce the communication cost. This is not
reflected in the above work.


III. F EDERATED L EARNING A PPLICATION P ROBLEM

D ESCRIPTION IN I NDUSTRIAL I NTERNET OF T HINGS

The core goal of FL is to carry out efficient ML among
multi-UEs or multiple computing nodes under the premise of
ensuring the security and privacy of data communication [33].
IIoT equipments need to upload the local model to a central
server after using local data for model training, and the central
server will optimize the global model. The general steps are:

1) IIoT equipments use local data for local calculation,
while minimizing the predefined empirical risk function,
and then update the calculated weight to the wireless
network access point.
2) The wireless network access point collects the weight
of IIoT equipment update and accesses the FL unit to
generate the global model.



3) FL redistributes the output of model training to IIoT
equipments, which use global models for a new round
of local training.
4) Repeat the above steps 2 and 3 until the loss function
converges or reaches the maximum number of iterations.

Suppose that there are _N_ IIoT equipment nodes in an
IIoT scenario, the local data set composed of local data of
each IIoT-DN is _{X_ 1 _, X_ 2 _, ..., X_ _N_ _}_ . The IIoT equipment node
downloads the global model _θ_ from the central server and
trains them by local data set alignment. IIoT equipment node
uploads new weights or gradients to a central server to update
the global model. Therefore, the data sample size from _N_ IIoT
equipment node is [�] _[N]_ _n_ =1 _[x]_ _[n]_ [ =] _[ X]_ [. Then the loss function of]
IIoT equipment node with data set _X_ _N_ is



_F_ _n_ ( _θ_ ) ≜ [1]

_x_ _n_



� _f_ _j_ ( _θ_ ) _,_ (1)

where _f_ _j_ ( _θ_ ) is the loss function of data sample _j_ . Optimize
the global loss function by minimizing the weighted average
of the local loss function _F_ _n_ ( _θ_ ) of each IIoT equipment node
training sample:

We summarize the loss functions of several common ML

models that can be used for FL in TABLE II [34]. DRL agent
training real data from IIoT equipments has more advantages
than agent data provided by the data center. The data generated
by IIoT equipments is usually highly secretive and large in
scale. DRL agents also need to record them on a central
server when they are trained based on local models. In order
to better verify the effectiveness of FL assisted by DRL, we
extract the data characteristics generated by IIoT equipments
as follows: (1) high privacy, (2) unbalanced amount of data
(a lot of user output is used, the user output is low), (3)
the distribution scale is large, and (4) the user equipment is
limited by the communication quality. Corresponding to the
actual situation of the data generated by IIoT equipments, our
experiments are carried out on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and
CIFAR-10 (independent and identically distributed (IID) and
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)). The
reason for using the above data sets is that they can reflect
the characteristics of data heterogeneity, scale difference and
dispersion to a certain extent.
In the case of non-IID, the data between users can be divided
equally or unequal. We assume that there is a fixed number
of IIoT devices in each round of communication between the

server and devices. When the communication process starts,
the devices are randomly divided into several groups, and the
server will send the current global model parameters to each
device. In order to improve the communication quality, we use
DRL algorithm based on DDPG to select some device nodes
to participate in the training. After that, each selected device
will calculate according to the global state and local data set,
and then send the update to the server. The server uses this
repeated method to update the global model parameters. In

this way, the non-IID characteristics of IIoT device data can
be considered. The experimental setup part will be introduced
in detail later.


IV. I MPLEMENTATION OF F EDERATED L EARNING

A LGORITHM A SSISTED BY DRL


In this part, we will give a FL framework assisted by DRL
in section IV-A, which is the core technology to realize the
data training of IIoT equipment. Based on this framework,
we will describe in detail the implementation steps of the FL
algorithm assisted by DRL in section IV-B. Finally, we will
introduce the process of applying DRL algorithm to achieve
IIoT equipment selection.


_A. Framework_


The purpose of integrating DRL into FL is to intelligently
use the cooperation between IIoT equipments and nodes to
exchange learning parameters, so as to better train the local
model [35]. Due to the limited cache and performance calculation of the edge IIoT equipments and nodes, and the direct
transmission of a large amount of data may cause network
channel congestion or even data leakage, and so the data is
trained in the local equipment. Therefore, we make full use of
the efficient model training performance of DRL and conduct
data confidentiality training based on FL. The final purpose
is to verify the training effectiveness of equipment data in
IIoT. We deploy DRL agents in every edge IIoT equipment.
Considering the inherent characteristics of wireless network,
if the amount of data to be trained is large, it will increase the
burden on the wireless network channel. Moreover, the data
needs to be transformed for privacy reasons, so the correlation



where _F_ ( _θ_ ) is the _n_ -th local loss function.



of the central server-side agent data may not be as good as
the data on the edge equipments. In addition, deploying DRL
agents on edge equipments alone may cause additional energy
consumption.
To deal with the above problems, we propose a FL framework assisted by DRL, as shown in Fig. 2. Considering a large
number of data factors, we adopt the distributed deep learning
(DL) method. As shown in TABLE I, distributed DL has good
performance of fast training and edge efficiency. Therefore, the
fast training of the data on edge equipments can avoid network
congestion to certain extents. Considering that the correlation
of agent data on the central server is not as good as that
of the edge equipment, in the IIoT scenario, a large number
of IIoT equipments are equipped with perceptron, which can
obtain rich and personalized data to update the global model.
Based on these data, the central server-side agent data can be
effectively updated to match the data of the edge equipment
side. The FL framework based on DRL mainly completes three
tasks: node selection, local training and global aggregation.
Node selection is achieved by using the DRL algorithm based
on DDPG, in order to select IIoT nodes with high data quality
to participate in the model training process. The purpose of
local training is to derive local model parameters suitable for
local nodes. The purpose of global aggregation is to generate
a global model suitable for data training, which is achieved
by uploading local model parameters to each local server.


_B. Implementation Steps_

The FL framework assisted by DRL has three main implementation stages:

1) Initialization stage: The central server evaluates the
connection request of IIoT equipments. After that, the
central server randomly selects a subset of user equipment from the connected IIoT equipments to participate
in this round of training [36], [37]. After training, a
global model _θ_ _t_ is sent to each selected IIoT equipment.
2) Training stage: The selected IIoT equipment uses local
data to train the global model, and the training process is
_θ_ _t_ _→_ _θ_ _t_ _[n]_ [, get the global model] _[ θ]_ _t_ _[n]_ [+1] after each iteration.
For the _n_ -th IIoT equipment, the optimization objective

3) Aggregation stage: All selected IIoT equipments upload
the local training model to the central server, then the
central server updates and trains the new global model
_θ_ _t_ _[n]_ [+1] for the next iteration. After that, the central server
issues the new global model to the newly selected IIoT
equipment collection. Repeat the above process until the
loss function converges or reaches the maximum number
of iterations.


In the FL algorithm assisted by DRL that we designed,
we select IIoT equipments with a proportion of _C_ in each
round and then calculate the gradient loss of these IIoT
equipment data. For IIoT equipment _n_, calculate the gradient
_g_ _n_ = _∇F_ _n_ ( _θ_ _t_ ) under the current model _θ_ _t_ and then aggregate
these gradients by the central server. Use the following formula
to update:



2) Cyclic scheduling strategy: The central server divides
all IIoT devices into _G_ groups. Each time a group is
selected to build a channel for communication, and the
model parameters are updated cyclically during each
communication.

3) Proportional fairness strategy: In each round of communication, select _N_ from _C_ related IIoT devices according
to the following calculation method:



_i_ _[∗]_ = arg max _{_ _[ρ]_ [�] _[i]_ [1] _[,][t]_
_i⊂{_ 1 _,_ 2 _,...,C}_ ~~_ρ_~~ _i_ 1 _,t_

~~_ρ_~~ _i_ 1 _,t_ ~~_ρ_~~ _i_ _N_ _,t_



where _i_ = _{i_ 1 _, i_ 2 _, ..., i_ _N_ _}_ is a vector of length _N_ . _i_ _[∗]_ =
_{i_ _[∗]_ _i_ _[, i]_ 2 _[∗]_ _[, ..., i]_ _[∗]_ _N_ _[}]_ [ represents the index number of IIoT device.]
_ρ_ � _i_ _i_ _,t_ and ~~_ρ_~~ _i_ _i_ _,t_ represent the instantaneous and time average
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of IIoT device _i_ _n_ during the _t_ -th
communication, respectively.
The SNR received at the central server is expressed as
follows:


_P_ _ut_ _h_ _k_ _||c_ _k_ _||_ _[−][β]_
_γ_ _k,t_ = ~~�~~ _P_ _ut_ _h_ _c_ _||c||_ _[−][β]_ + _σ_ [2] _[,]_ (6)

_c∈_ Ψ [�] _[k]_ _u_


where _β_ represents the link loss index, _h_ _k_ represents the smallscale fading,Ψ� _[k]_ _u_ [represents the position of IIoT device] _σ_ [2] is the variance of Gaussian additive noise, and _[ k]_ [.]
An important purpose of model training is parameter update. At the number of communication rounds _t_, when the

central server establishes a transmission channel with a certain

IIoT equipment and successfully decodes the sent data, the
parameter _δv_ _k_ _[t]_ [can be updated from IIoT equipment to the]
central server. We use the probability of successful parameter
update to indicate the transmission performance of the wireless
channel, which is expressed as follows:


_U_ _k_ _[b]_ [=] _[ P]_ [(] _[γ]_ _[k,t]_ _[> θ, S]_ _k,t_ _[b]_ [= 1)] _[,]_ (7)


where _γ_ _k,t_ represents the instantaneous and time average
signal-to-noise ratio at the central server. _S_ _k,t_ _[b]_ _∈{_ 0 _,_ 1 _}_
represents the selection index, where _b_ represents different

_n_ =1



_N_ _n_ (4)

_N_ _[g]_ _[n]_ _[ →]_ _[θ]_ _[t]_ [+1] _[.]_



The operation of selecting specific IIoT devices is called a
scheduling strategy. Since the reading and execution of data
in the central server and the reading and execution of data in
various IIoT devices are not in the same order of magnitude,
uploading the training and updated models of all IIoT devices
to the global controller will cause a lot of computing time
and communication overhead. Therefore, it is an effective
way to select a specific part of equipment upload parameter
model through the scheduling strategy. Scheduling strategies
play a crucial role in allocating wireless channels with limited
resources to appropriate IIoT devices. Use _S_ = _N_ _[C]_ [to represent]

the ratio of the number of IIoT devices to the number of sub
channels. There are mainly three commonly used scheduling
strategies:


1) Random scheduling strategy: In each round of communication, the central server randomly selects _N_ related
IIoT devices for parameter update. At the same time, a
dedicated sub-channel is built between the central server

and the selected user equipment to transmit training

parameters.


IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2020 6



scheduling strategies. When _S_ _k,t_ _[b]_ [= 1][, it means that the]
communication time has started between the central server

and IIoT equipment _k_, otherwise there is no communication.


_C. IIoT Equipment Node Selection Based on DRL_


Due to the different uses and geographical distribution of
IIoT equipments, the data they generate will have the characteristics of heterogeneity, and the quality of the data will also
vary. The problems of low data training efficiency, long model
aggregation time and high wireless communication cost caused
by data characteristics are major challenges in the application
of FL in the field of IIoT. Therefore, in order to improve
the quality of model aggregation and reduce communication
costs, inspired by reference [20], we use DRL algorithm to
select IIoT equipment nodes with accurate learning models.
The main idea is to model the local training cost of IIoT
equipments and describe the problem as a MDP. We use DDPG
to find the optimal solution of MDP. DRL agent continuously
interacts with the environment to accumulate maximum reward

and the essential purpose is to minimize the cost of FL.
We first give the cost index for selecting IIoT equipment
nodes. The total cost of node selection in FL algorithm is
composed of training time cost and training quality cost. The
training time cost of local IIoT equipment is



where _δ_ _[t]_ represents the selection status of the IIoT equipment
node. When the IIoT equipment node _i_ is selected, _δ_ _i_ _[t]_ [= 1][,]
otherwise _δ_ _i_ _[t]_ [= 0][.]
The DRL agent trains the local model by interacting with the
environment, and then we use the DDPG to select the optimal
solution for IIoT equipment node. In the DRL algorithm, we
use the reward function to evaluate the effect of taking action
_a_ _t_ . The evaluation method is as follows:

train the model _m_ on the data _d_ _i_, _µ_ _i_ represents the computing
resources available to IIoT equipment _i_, and _τ_ represents the
transmission rate of the wireless network channel.

The DDPG uses a value function to determine the strategy,
which mainly includes an actor deep neural network (DNN)
_π_ ( _s_ _t_ _|θ_ _pi_ ) and a critic DNN _Q_ ( _s_ _t_ _, a_ _t_ _|θ_ _Q_ ). The DDPG uses
historical experience stored in local replay memory to perform
information conversion. The converted information includes

the current state _s_ _t_, the action taken _a_ _t_, the next state _s_ _t_ +1
and the reward _r_ ( _s_ _t_ _, a_ _t_ ) obtained by taking the action _a_ _t_ . The
target network generates target values to train the critic DNN
model.

The specific pseudo code is given in Algorithm 1, where the
client label is indexed by _n_, _B_ represents the local mini batch
size, _E_ represents the number of local epoch, _α_ represents the
learning rate.


V. E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP AND R ESULT A NALYSIS


In this part, we evaluate the performance of FL algorithm
assisted by DRL based on MNIST, Fashion MNIST and
CIFAR-10 (IID and non-IID). Since the above data sets reflect
the characteristics of IIoT equipment data, we mainly test the
accuracy of the algorithm in training the above data sets. This
shows that the FL algorithm assisted by DRL has advantages
in training IIoT equipment data.


_A. Experimental Setup_


Considering the host performance, we mainly use several
small agent data sets to test the algorithm performance.
MNIST data set and Fashion MNIST data set are mainly used
for number recognition tasks. The former uses a simple multilayer perception (MLP) with two hidden layers, in which each
layer has 200 units and is activated by the ReLU function [38].
The latter is trained by CNN, which has a fully connected
layer (512 units and ReLU function), a softmax output layer
and two 5 _×_ 5 convolution layers. To fully study FL, we use
two data partitioning methods for IIoT equipments. The first is
the IID of data shuffling and then divided into 100 equipment

quality of the network model, _w_ _[t]_ represents the training model
aggregated in time slot _t_, and _d_ _i_ represents the training data

FL algorithm in time slot _t_ is


_C_ _[t]_ = _C_ _time_ _[t]_ [+] _[ C]_ _qu_ _[t]_ _[.]_ (10)


The node selection of IIoT equipment is a combinatorial
optimization problem. We model it as a MDP, denoted by
_M_ = _{S, A, P_ _A_ _, C_ _A_ _}_ . Among them, _S_ represents the state
space of IIoT equipment node, _A_ represents the action space,
_P_ _A_ represents the state change probability of the action taken,
and _C_ _A_ represents the cost of the new state produced by the
action. Therefore, the selection problem of IIoT equipment
nodes is expressed as:

receiving 600 data samples respectively. The second is the
non-IID which classifies the data according to the digital tags,
which is divided into 200 pieces of 300 pieces and each
client is allocated 2 pieces. This setting method can explore
the breaking degree of the algorithm on highly non-IID data.
CIFAR-10 data consists of 10 classes of 32 _×_ 32 images with
three GRB channels. We used 50,000 training cases and 10,000
test cases and distributed them equally to 100 equipment.


_B. Performance Evaluation_


We first explore the impact of the number of IIoT equipment, i.e., the number of clients, on the MNIST data set and
fashion MNIST data set models. The client ratio _C_ controls

the number of multi client parallelism. Because we use 100
IIoT device as clients, when _C_ = 0, it represents one client,
followed by 10, 20, 50 and 100 clients in turn. TABLE III
shows the number of communication rounds that different

|Fashion<br>MNIST<br>_E_ = 5|0.5|164|18|1067|261|

the two data sets.

Fig. 4: Experimental results of Fashion MNIST data set.


When _B_ = _∞_ is used for data training, all 600 data samples
are treated as a single batch processing in each round. At this
time, increasing the proportion of clients can only show a
small advantage. When _B_ = 10 is used for batch processing
(especially when _C ≥_ 0 _._ 1), the advantage of communication
round number change is obvious. In order to balance the
computational efficiency and the convergence rate, we fix
_C_ = 0 _._ 1. Figs. 3 and 4 show the gradual improvement of
the accuracy of MNIST data set and Fashion MNIST data set
after different training rounds. Each data set is trained based
on IID data and non-IID data, respectively. It can be seen




IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2020 8



that after about 1,000 rounds of communication, the accuracy
rate of MNIST data set can reach 99% and then it tends to

be stable. After about 2,000 rounds of communication, the
training accuracy of the Fashion MNIST data set reached 97%
and stabilized.

Fig. 5: The convergence of the loss value.


Fig. 5 shows the convergence of the loss value during the
training of MNIST data set. The loss value of MNIST data set
based on IID data and non-IID data decreases and converges
with the increase of communication rounds. After about 1,000
rounds of communication, the loss value is stable at a low
level, which shows the rationality of the loss function and the
effectiveness of the training method. The experimental results
of training loss value on Fashion MNIST data set show that
the loss value of fashion MNIST data set converges with the
increase of communication rounds, which is similar to MNIST

data set.

Since the CIFAR-10 data set has no natural user partition,
we consider the balancing and IID settings. The architecture of
the training model is derived from Tensorflow, which mainly
includes two convolution layers, two full connection layers
and one linear conversion layer. In the process of training, we
use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method for small batch
training with size of 100. Fig. 6 shows the relationship between
the test accuracy of CIFAR-10 data set and the number of
communication rounds.

Through the above experiments, we can see the advantages
of the FL algorithm assisted by DRL in training the data of



TABLE IV: Number of communication rounds required to


IIoT equipment. Considering the outstanding characteristics
of heterogeneity and privacy of data generated by IIoT equipments, we use MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data
sets to represent them. Based on MLP and CNN to train the
above data sets, the training accuracy is rising in the process of
continuous communication between the client and the central

server. Among them, CIFAR-10 data set can achieve 85% test
accuracy, while MNIST and Fashion MNIST data sets can
achieve more than 98% training accuracy. Therefore, it can be
shown that the FL algorithm assisted by DRL has excellent
performance and has the ability to effectively manage and train
the equipment data of IIoT.
In addition, we compare the algorithm proposed in this
paper with a baseline algorithm called FedSGD [39]. In
each round of communication, we select IIoT devices with a
proportion of _C_, and then calculate the loss gradient of these
devices. We fix the value of _C_ to 0.1, and then discuss the
number of communication rounds required for the algorithm
to achieve the target accuracy when _B_ or _E_ changes. The
results are shown in TABLE IV.

It can be seen from the table that the change of _E_ value and
_B_ value has obvious influence on the number of communication rounds. We set the target accuracy to 98%. For IID data,
increasing the value of _E_ and reducing the value of _B_ can
significantly reduce the number of communication rounds to
reach this accuracy. But for non-IID data, although the number
of communication rounds will be reduced, the overall effect
is not obvious. In general, the larger _E_ is and the smaller
_B_ is, the optimization effect is more obvious. So overall, the
algorithm proposed in this paper is effective in improving the
data training rate. Each selected IIoT device calculates the
average gradient of local data based on the current model, and
then the central server aggregates these gradients and updates
them using equation (4). Each IIoT device uses its local data
to perform one-step gradient descent based on the current
model, and then the server performs a weighted average of the
generated model. The final algorithm achieved good results.


VI. C ONCLUSION


IIoT is the key technology to realize industry 4.0 and it is
also the objective embodiment of the development degree of
industry 4.0. What cannot be ignored is that the current IIoT is


IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS, VOL. XX, NO. XX, XX 2020 9



facing the management and training problems brought by the
explosive growth of user data. The emergence of FL provides
a new solution paradigm for heterogeneous data and private
data training, and it can support the development of IIoT in
a way that reduces model deviation. This paper mainly aims
at the problem of how to manage and train a large amount of
data produced by IIoT, and proposes a FL algorithm assisted
by DRL in wireless network environments. DRL based on
DDPG is mainly used for the selection of IIoT equipment
nodes. We fully analyze the heterogeneity and privacy of the
data generated by IIoT equipments. In the experimental phase,
we use MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets to
represent IIoT equipment data. The final results show that
the FL algorithm assisted by DRL can effectively train the
above data sets and achieve a high accuracy rate, which shows
the effectiveness of the FL algorithm assisted by DRL in the
management of IIoT equipment data.
